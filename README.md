# API Development and Documentation Final Project

## Trivia App

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

The Trivia app is able to perform the following tasks:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.



## Getting Started

### Base URL: 

At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration.

The frontend app is hosted on http://127.0.0.1:3000/.

### Error Handling

Errors are formatted as JSON objects

```
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 404,
    "message": "Resource Not found"
}
```
The API is expected to return four error types when requests fail:

400: Bad Request
404: Resource Not Found
422: Not Processable
405: Resource Not found
